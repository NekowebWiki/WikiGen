* Small attribution addition in copying: https://wiki.nekoweb.org/copying.html
* There's not a separate attribute for page descriptions and subtitles, as an example, the page on Nekoweb now has a differing description from its subtitle: https://wiki.nekoweb.org/w/nekoweb.html
* Use <code>&lt;place-toc /&gt;</code> to manually set the location of the table of contents. This lets you put the table of contents after the first paragraph, like in the Markdown reference: https://wiki.nekoweb.org/md-ref.html
