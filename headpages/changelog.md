* Small attribution addition in copying: https://wiki.nekoweb.org/copying.html

* Use <code>&lt;place-toc /&gt;</code> to manually set the location of the table of contents. This lets you put the table of contents after the first paragraph, like in the Markdown reference: https://wiki.nekoweb.org/md-ref.html
* Syntax highlighting on codeblocks. Code colors are in syntaxcolors.py.
