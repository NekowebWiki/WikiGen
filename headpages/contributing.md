The Nekoweb Wiki encourages everyone to contribute! Here is a guide on how to contribute.

1. If you don't already have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), create one.
2. Go to [the wiki repository](https://github.com/NekowebWiki/WikiGen) on GitHub.
3. Click "Fork."
4. Make the change(s) you are intending to make. For editing pages, see [the Markdown reference](/md-ref.html).
5. [Create a new PR](https://github.com/NekowebWiki/WikiGen/compare) and click "compare across forks."
6. Click into the selection labeled "head repository" and then select the branch that you pushed your changes to in the selection next to it.
7. Click "Create Pull Request." Now see [Taking feedback](#taking-feedback).

## Taking feedback

After making your pull request, you may get comments and change requests from community members. It is suggested that you read this feedback, and try to improve where possible. You won't need to make a new PR, as GitHub automatically updates the request every time a new change is made to the branch where you pushed your changes to.
