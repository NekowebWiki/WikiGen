## What is Nekoweb?

Nekoweb is a free static (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) web hosting service.

It was created on 2024 by a [group of coders, programmers and artists](https://nekoweb.org/credits)
, with the goal of 'That everyone should be able to freely express themselves in their own little corner of the web'.

## History of Nekoweb

Before Nekoweb was launched on 25 February 2024, Nekoweb development
started on August 26 2022, and was in development for 2 years.


- **26/08/2022**: The first mention of the name Nekoweb is made by fish (ilovebjork123).
- **26/08/2022**: The development of Nekoweb starts and the Nekoweb
  catagory in the NeoNet discord is created.
- **14/09/2022**: Discussion of Nekoweb freezes until 07/09/2023
- **07/02/2023**: The Nekoweb Discord is launched.
- **07/02/2023**: dimden shares some screenshots of Nekoweb in the Discord, and that Nekoweb has 50 users.
- **08/02/2023**: dimden announces that the possibility to import, export
  and upload big files is done.
- **09/02/2023**: dimden asks the community for 88x31 buttons and banner,
  who show randomly when the website is refreshed, and that the
  explore/search page is fully done and working. And the site box layout
  will probably be remade.
- **13/02/2023**: dimden shares a screenshot contain a picture of the
  password reset page, and announces that the patreon integration is
  done.
- **17/02/2023**: dimden announces that the settings and account page are
  probably done.
- **24/05/2023**: dimden announces that Nekoweb has 200 members.
- **31/08/2023**: dimden shares an screenshot with a possible redesign.
- **20/02/2024**: dimden announces that Nekoweb is kind of dead since the
  developers are too busy/lazy with other things, and that dimden thinks
  of launching Nekoweb without the social media features and just web
  hosting only. dimden also says that the most of Nekoweb is already
  done, except the social media features, and that the developers don't
  have the time to create them, and hopefully add them later. The
  community is asked what they think about it.
- **25/02/2024**: dimden announces that Nekoweb is done and launched after
  2 years (and doing some 'yardwork' since 20/02/2024), and he
  recommends to sign up now, since there is no invite system yet, and
  that Nekoweb is in beta and bugs may happen.
- **25/02/2024**: dimden announces (again) that Nekoweb is accepting 88x31
  button and banner submissions, and that (when the banner is clicked)
  it will probably link to the website of the maker, and that Nekoweb
  has 500 users in 12 hours.

  > browser stuff but for most users itll be blank so keep this in mind)
  > some site boxes were already affected by this! it can take few
  > refreshes to see if it got broke (ironically CTRL+SHIFT+R makes it
  > show and unbreak which is usually good but not in this case, so dont

- 08/04/24: dimden announces new updates, and 'very very very very good ones too':
  > most importantly, an actual gamechanger: introducing NekoVM, a Linux
  > with Node.js and NPM running inside your browser, with full
  > read/write access to your site filesystem. what this means? you can
  > now use any static site builder or framework to build your site.
  > literally any framework, fr like actually! available to everyone
  > too, not just donators! theres also support for local port
  > forwarding so you can for example run vite dev server with
  > frameworks that support it :OOO this is still beta. report any bugs
  > when u see them and backup ur site before doing anything in
  > terminal. you can launch your site in terminal about once per minute
  > (opening site in terminal counts to import/export zip rate limit
  > which is currently 1 time per 1 minute (2 times for donators))
  > 
  > i extremely recommend you watch video i made about me building demo
  > Svelte app using Nekoweb Terminal to see how cool this thing is:

  > theres also 2 more cool features: you can now remove .html from your
  > links! this was a very requested feature and now its here, you can
  > enable this in site settings theres now support for setting custom
  > HTTP headers for donators, also in settings!
  > 
  > while NekoVM is still Beta, this update log marks Nekoweb Release™️,
  > yea if u didnt notice nekoweb was still beta all this time. nekoweb
  > has been running for almost 2 months now and most of issues have
  > been fixed and things seem to run nicely. i hope itll continue to be
  > this way thats all for now! check the video!!!!! its awesome
