## What is Nekoweb?

Nekoweb is a free static (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) web hosting service.

It was created on 2024 by a [group of coders, programmers and artists](https://nekoweb.org/credits)
, with the goal of 'That everyone should be able to freely express themselves in their own little corner of the web'.

## History of Nekoweb

Before Nekoweb was launched on 25 February 2024, Nekoweb development
started on August 26 2022, and was in development for 2 years.


- **26/08/2022**: The first mention of the name Nekoweb is made by fish (ilovebjork123).
- **26/08/2022**: The development of Nekoweb starts and the Nekoweb
  catagory in the NeoNet discord is created.
- **14/09/2022**: Discussion of Nekoweb freezes until 07/09/2023
- **07/02/2023**: The Nekoweb Discord is launched.
- **07/02/2023**: dimden shares some screenshots of Nekoweb in the Discord, and that Nekoweb has 50 users.
- **08/02/2023**: dimden announces that the possibility to import, export
  and upload big files is done.
- **09/02/2023**: dimden asks the community for 88x31 buttons and banner,
  who show randomly when the website is refreshed, and that the
  explore/search page is fully done and working. And the site box layout
  will probably be remade.
- **13/02/2023**: dimden shares a screenshot contain a picture of the
  password reset page, and announces that the patreon integration is
  done.
- **17/02/2023**: dimden announces that the settings and account page are
  probably done.
- **24/05/2023**: dimden announces that Nekoweb has 200 members.
- **31/08/2023**: dimden shares an screenshot with a possible redesign.
- **20/02/2024**: dimden announces that Nekoweb is kind of dead since the
  developers are too busy/lazy with other things, and that dimden thinks
  of launching Nekoweb without the social media features and just web
  hosting only. dimden also says that the most of Nekoweb is already
  done, except the social media features, and that the developers don't
  have the time to create them, and hopefully add them later. The
  community is asked what they think about it.
- **25/02/2024**: dimden announces that Nekoweb is done and launched after
  2 years (and doing some 'yardwork' since 20/02/2024), and he
  recommends to sign up now, since there is no invite system yet, and
  that Nekoweb is in beta and bugs may happen.
- **25/02/2024**: dimden announces (again) that Nekoweb is accepting 88x31
  button and banner submissions, and that (when the banner is clicked)
  it will probably link to the website of the maker, and that Nekoweb
  has 500 users in 12 hours.

  > - you can now follow people !!! press [+] on right of username

  additions:

  > page
  > - due to explore page being 70 megabytes now there is now a size
  > limit for assets used in your site box: 2.5 MB. if you use image
  > that exceeds it, it wont be loaded (sometimes it can load due to
  > browser stuff but for most users itll be blank so keep this in mind)
  > some site boxes were already affected by this! it can take few
  > refreshes to see if it got broke (ironically CTRL+SHIFT+R makes it
  > show and unbreak which is usually good but not in this case, so dont
  > use it to check and instead use normal refreshes) (

  > enough to send emails - also its required to verify email now on new
  > registers
  > - and lot of other small bugfixes etc etc nobody cares

- 08/04/24: dimden announces new updates, and 'very very very very good ones too':
  > most importantly, an actual gamechanger: introducing NekoVM, a Linux
  > with Node.js and NPM running inside your browser, with full
  > read/write access to your site filesystem. what this means? you can
  > now use any static site builder or framework to build your site.
  > literally any framework, fr like actually! available to everyone
  > too, not just donators! theres also support for local port
  > forwarding so you can for example run vite dev server with
  > frameworks that support it :OOO this is still beta. report any bugs
  > when u see them and backup ur site before doing anything in
  > terminal. you can launch your site in terminal about once per minute
  > (opening site in terminal counts to import/export zip rate limit
  > which is currently 1 time per 1 minute (2 times for donators))
  > 
  > i extremely recommend you watch video i made about me building demo
  > Svelte app using Nekoweb Terminal to see how cool this thing is:
  >
  > https://lune.dimden.dev/4085d4ed0d4a.mp4
  >
  > (video embed below)
  >
  > theres also 2 more cool features: you can now remove .html from your
  > links! this was a very requested feature and now its here, you can
  > enable this in site settings theres now support for setting custom
  > HTTP headers for donators, also in settings!
  > 
  > while NekoVM is still Beta, this update log marks Nekoweb Release™️,
  > yea if u didnt notice nekoweb was still beta all this time. nekoweb
  > has been running for almost 2 months now and most of issues have
  > been fixed and things seem to run nicely. i hope itll continue to be
  > this way thats all for now! check the video!!!!! its awesome

  > support for dynamic sites soon.

- **13/06/2024**: Dimden announces:
  > default nekoweb theme (classic) will be removed soon because person
  > who made it doesnt want it to be on nekoweb we're still accepting
  > submissions for themes, and will pick some as default one in near

  > hopefully.

- **28/07/2024**: Dimden announces:
  
  > Hi, there's some improvements and bug fixes in the dashboard and editor.
  >
  > * Fixed moving files and folders
  > * You can now sort files in dashboard by name, size or last modified
  > * You can now see size and last modified date of files by hovering on them

- **16/08/2024**: Dimden announces:
  > Now following page is better, it sorts and groups sites by last updated date. This allows you to actually keep track of updates in sites you follow. That's what following is for, idk why this wasn't done earlier

- **16/08/2024**: Dimden announces:
  > New API endpoint to check ur rate limit!
  > Also allowed more zip API requests to donators

- **02/09/2024**: Dimden announces:
  > Hoster that hosts Nekoweb server is having some serious issues, so we are currently down too. So we've decided to switch          server ASAP to a new hoster that will be much more stable and shouldn't have any downtimes. New server will also be much more     powerful and larger, so we will be able to grow for a very long time without any worries.

  > We expect it to be back up today, and then we'll be able to safely switch to new hoster with all current data. But if hoster      won't be up within a day, we'll use our last backup that might be up to 12 hours old. Then we'll be able to bring back any        edits you did in last 12 hours upon support request, once original hoster is back up.
  
  > Nekoweb is back up! This means we can safely move to new server with current data.

- **27/09/2024**: Dimden announces:
  >I've been coding my own, [much faster http server](https://github.com/dimdenGD/ultimate-express) and      >yesterday migrated Nekoweb to use it. But it's
  >still very new so there are a bunch of bugs that are   getting fixed as people report them. Bugs can
  >include:
  >* files showing 404 even if they exist
  >* files not updating even after CTRL+SHIFT+R
  >* 403 errors
  >* and other random issues
  >
  >Please report bugs you get in ⁠suggestions-bugs-etc and they'll be fixed. Basically, any behavior that     suddenly became different since yesterday is probably a bug.

- **20/10/2024**: Dimden announces:
  >Now there's an option to enable strict slashes (sorry for unnecessary ping). https://lune.dimden.dev/3d593959838b.png

- **18-04-2025**: Dimden announces:
  >Since Nekoweb Discord is getting pretty large, ⁠general and ⁠buffer-overflow are getting quite cluttered with a lot of messages, and it's kinda reaching it's limit with possible topics at once. I always      >wanted to separate different interests but I always hated having a huge amount of channels (and a lot of interests might be too niche or different from Nekoweb itself). So there's a nice solution to this:
  >
  >Nekoweb Discord is launching ⁠clubs ! This is a forum channel that will include admin-approved clubs where you'll be able to talk about various interests.
  >Each club will have it's own President that will moderate it and oversee that everything's good and on-topic there. They have @Club President role that allows them to moderate the messages in their         >thread.
  >You can submit applications to launch your own club in ⁠club-applications and become it's President! The club you want to launch should be have some kind of interest (at least 4 members that would talk      >there).
  >Please review the list of clubs in ⁠clubs before submitting application for new one. You should also write in the application why do you think you would be a good President for the club you want to          >create. Getting people to vouch for you is also a great way to get approval chance higher. A person can only be a president of 1 club. Do not submit multiple applications for different clubs. Also keep     >in mind that being a president will require your attention and responsibility! If you're no longer active, or don't moderate good enough, your club will either be removed or presidency will be              >transferred to someone else.
  >
  >Looking forward to have more clubs !!! Also, now that Zine applications are now closed, we are in process of reviewing them all. Stay tuned.

- **18-04-2025**: Dimden announces:
  >Club applications were moved to ⁠club-applications! All existing applications in ⁠suggestions-bugs-etc will be locked and in a few days deleted, so please recreate your application if you have a pending      >application there.
  >
  >Please read POST GUIDELINES before submitting application. It was now updated with new rules and information.
