## What is NekoVM?
NekoVM is a Linux emulator that runs in the browser, with Node.js, NPM and full read/write access.

NekoVM is used to build sites with static site generators or frameworks, and has (as stated by Dimden) support for any static site generator or framework.

Currently, you can launch NekoVM 1 time per 1 minute. But if you are a donator, you can launch NekoVM 2 times per 1 minute.
