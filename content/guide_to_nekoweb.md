### How to create/upload custom cursors.
One of the cool features is the custom cursor others can see on the
main Nekoweb site! In order to create one of these, you need to create
an 12x17 (16x21 for supporters) pixel PNG file.

After creating your PNG file, you must upload it to your site's root
directory for it to appear. You now have a cool looking cursor that
others can see!
