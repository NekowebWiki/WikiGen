Nekode is a web editor for Nekoweb based on open-source VSCode, and is currently in beta. When out of beta, It's required to have the Cute kitty tier as Nekode requires a large load on the Nekoweb servers.

Nekode has the following features:
- Is connected to your site filesystem
- Changes on your site instantly visble using Live Preview
- Integration with [Nekogit](https://wiki.nekoweb.org/w/nekogit.html)
- Search all your site files instantly
- Upload, rename, remove, and do other manipulations with files directly in the editor
- Install a (limited) set of VSCode extensions
- Different themes
- VSCode telemetry is removed
