title: Custom domains and subdomains
---
## Custom domain(s)
With Nekoweb, you have the ability to add your own custom domain(s) to
your site. You need to be a donator to do this.

You can have a maximum of 10 custom domains on one account.

You can have subdomains on your own custom domain(s).

## What is a subdomain?
A subdomain is a prefix to a domain name, like:
`https://subdomain.domain.tld`.

## Nekoweb subdomain
On Nekoweb, when registering an account, your username becomes the
subdomain of the domain nekoweb.org (like https://wiki.nekoweb.org),
what points to your site.

As donator, you can claim multiple subdomains.

## Types of subdomains on Nekoweb
Nekoweb supports 3 types of subdomains: Text only, Numbers only, Text
and numbers, and dashed.

## Nested subdomains on Nekoweb
You can add nested subdomains as a Nekoweb subdomain (As of 14/5/24),
but they does not work when trying to access them, and give this
error:
